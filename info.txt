Task information
Topic: Spring MVC
Task:
1. Create web application with configured Spring MVC dispatcher servlet and application context.
2. Create model beans and DAO layer for users and mentorship programs (make it as simple as possible, can be in-memory Map<Id, Bean> with sample data).
3. Implement service layer for operating with the model above.
4. Add controllers capable of creating domain objects, editing, getting by id, deleting and searching by simple criteria.
5. Add View resolver and write simple front-end pages (JSP or FreeMarker or Velocity) to connect to controller logic.
Criteria:
- Your controllers should provide responses of various types: HTML pages and object-based (like JSON or XML)
- Custom formatter for Date fields should be configured
- Saving and editing must be accompanied with validation logic
- Exception handler should be configured and redirect to error page or return proper error message depending on controller type
- Remember about S.O.L.I.D. principles
Tips:task assumes certain knowledge of Servlet API and Spring Core: you might need to review webinars and browse through some examples.
